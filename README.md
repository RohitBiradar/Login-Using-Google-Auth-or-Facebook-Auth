# GOOGLE AUTHENTICATION AND FACEBOOK AUTHENTICATION IN NODE.JS

This module lets you authenticate using Google in your Node.js applications. By plugging into Passport, Google authentication can be easily and unobtrusively integrated into any application or framework that supports Connect-style middleware, including Express.

The Google OAuth 2.0 authentication strategy authenticates users using a Google account and OAuth 2.0 tokens. The strategy requires a verify callback, which accepts these credentials and calls done providing a user, as well as options specifying a client ID, client secret, and callback URL.
